I had some troube committing the text file, so I manually uploaded it via github to make sure the file was working fine, once i knew that, I deleted it and continued to trouble shoot the problem.
turns out i had to merge some remote changes by git pull origin, then git push origin solved the problem.  Solution found on stack overflow.
